  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_NO3DBORDER                  = $00000004;
    {MSHTML does not use 3-D borders on any frames or framesets. To turn the
    border off on only the outer frameset use DOCHOSTUIFLAG_NO3DOUTERBORDER}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_SCROLL_NO                   = $00000008;

    browse to the new site using the same browser window}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_DISABLE_OFFSCREEN           = $00000040;
    {Not implemented}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_FLAT_SCROLLBAR              = $00000080;
    {MSHTML uses flat scroll bars for any user interface (UI) it displays}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_DIV_BLOCKDEFAULT            = $00000100;
    {MSHTML inserts the div tag if a return is entered in edit mode. Without
    this flag, MSHTML will use the p tag}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_ACTIVATE_CLIENTHIT_ONLY     = $00000200;
    {MSHTML only becomes UI active if the mouse is clicked in the client area of
    the window. It does not become UI active if the mouse is clicked on a
    nonclient area, such as a scroll bar}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_OVERRIDEBEHAVIORFACTORY     = $00000400;
    {MSHTML consults the host before retrieving a behavior from the URL
    specified on the page. If the host does not support the behavior, MSHTML
    does not proceed to query other hosts or instantiate the behavior itself,
    even for behaviors developed in script (HTML Components (HTCs))}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_CODEPAGELINKEDFONTS         = $00000800;
    {IE5 or later. Provides font selection compatibility for Outlook Express. If
    the flag is enabled, the displayed characters are inspected to determine
    whether the current font supports the code page. If disabled, the current
    font is used, even if it does not contain a glyph for the character. This
    flag assumes that the user is using IE5 and OE4.0}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_URL_ENCODING_DISABLE_UTF8   = $00001000;
    {IE5 or later. Controls how nonnative URLs are transmitted over the
    Internet. Nonnative refers to characters outside the multibyte encoding of

    UTF-8 encoding}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_ENABLE_FORMS_AUTOCOMPLETE   = $00004000;
    {IE5 or later. This flag enables the AutoComplete feature for forms in the
    hosted browser. The Intelliforms feature is only turned on if the user has
    previously enabled it. If the user has turned the AutoComplete feature off
    for forms, it is off whether this flag is specified or not}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_ENABLE_INPLACE_NAVIGATION   = $00010000;
    {IE5 or later. This flag enables the host to specify that navigation should
    happen in place. This means that applications hosting MSHTML directly can
    specify that navigation happen in the application's window. For instance,
    if this flag is set, you can click a link in HTML mail and navigate in the
    mail instead of opening a new IE window}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_IME_ENABLE_RECONVERSION     = $00020000;
    {IE5 or later. During initialization, the host can set this flag to enable
    Input Method Editor (IME) reconversion, allowing computer users to employ
    IME reconversion while browsing Web pages}

  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_NO3DOUTERBORDER             = $00200000;
    {IE6 or later. Turns off any 3-D border on the outermost frame or frameset
    only. To turn borders off on all frame sets, use DOCHOSTUIFLAG_NO3DBORDER}
  // *** query these values
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_DISABLE_EDIT_NS_FIXUP       = $1;
    {IE6 or later. Disables the automatic correction of namespaces when editing
    HTML elements}
  DOCHOSTUIFLAG_LOCAL_MACHINE_ACCESS_CHECK  = $1;

    in the Local Machine zone}

          the parameter contains an IDispatch interface.
